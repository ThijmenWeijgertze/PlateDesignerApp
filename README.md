# PlateDesignerApp

## What's the app's purpose?
I couldn't find any "good" applications online to design my well plates. I also wanted to experiment using the package Shiny. After browsing I came across the ggplate package. I really liked how this package worked and so I made an app around it.

## Running locally
- Clone this repository using the git bash terminal: `git clone <NeedToSeekUpStill>`.
- Install the following package: bslib, shiny, readxl, ggplate (I'll automate this in the future)
- Open the project file in Rstudio.
- Open the app.R file -> press Run
- Or alternatively run `runApp(".")` in the R console

## Running via github pages
Work in progress. The site runs on github pages, but the download buttons fail to work.

## How to use?
- Run the app
- Download the Excel template in the UI or data/ folder
- Fill in your conditions in the Excel file 
- Press the browse button in the UI
- Load your Excel file
